        Hi all, this is the provisional Davis math circle site, with some basic information. Discord server <a href="discord.gg/eRbAjZk6xD">here</a>.
        <h2>FAQs</h2>
          <ol>
            <li><i>What is DMC and what is it for?</i><br>
            I am reviving the old DMC; the agenda is quite similar to the old one, being focused on high school math. There will be
            occasional forays into higher math. It will be a mixture of lectures and interactives. The inaugural revival meeting will 
            have free boba and a plank countdown.</li>
              <li><i>Where and when are the meetings happening?</i><br>
              They are currently slotted for Thursdays at 6PM at UCD Library, but this is subject to change
              after input from students and parents.</li>
            <li><i>What is happening at the first meeting and is it informational?</i><br>
            I plan on making the first meeting both informational and also running a plank countdown for the students. 
            (These do not conflict because I expect the parents to be asking the vast majority of the questions.)</li>
            <li><i>How do I sign up?</i><br>
            Signup Google form is <a href="https://forms.gle/MxX8LhSu8GA5nrDo7">here</a>.</li>

            <li><i>Who are you?</i><br>
            I am a local college student and MOP alumnus ('23) who still spends quite a lot of time on contest
            math. Accomplishments with my name can be
