\section{Motivation}
The most-used characteristic of the similicenter is that it lies on the line of centers. This allows 
one to connect otherwise unrelated lines. Plus, don't you think it's such a cool theorem? 
\section{Theory}
Depth limited, therefore this is jsut a list of fun facts apart from the first two results.
\begin{thm}[Fancy geometry parlance]
    Point $P$ is a \emph{similicenter} of two shapes $\mathcal A$, $\mathcal B$ if there's a homothety at 
    $P$ sending $\mathcal A\to\mathcal B$. 
    It is said to be an \emph{ex}similicenter or \emph{in}similicenter according to whether said homothety
    has positive or negative scale factor.
\end{thm}
Usually, the shapes in question are circles or polygons with $\le4$ sides.
\begin{thm}[Theorem (Monge)]
For any three circles $\omega_1,\omega_2,\omega_3$, pairwise exsimilicenters are collinear.
Also, the insimilicenter of two pairs of circles and 
the exsimilicenter of the third are collinear as well.
concur.
\end{thm}
\begin{thm}[Lemma: characterise exsimilicenter]
Let circles $\omega_1,\omega_2$ intersect at $A,B$ and have exsimilicenter $X$. 
Then \(\dangle AXB=\frac12\parenth{\widehat{AB}_{\omega_1}-\widehat{AB}_{\omega_2} }.\)
\end{thm}
\begin{thm}[Pitot]
Quadrilateral $ABCD$ has an incircle iff $AB+CD=AD+BC$, and has an excircle iff 
$AB+BC=AD+DC$ or $BA+AD=BC+CD$.
\end{thm}
\section{Problems}
\exercise[Iran TST 2020] Let $ABC$ be an isosceles triangle with $AB=AC$ and incenter $I$. 
 Circle $\omega$ passes through $C$ and $I$ and is tangent to $AI$. 
 Circle $\omega$ intersects $AC$ and circumcircle of $ABC$ at $Q$ and $D$, respectively. 
 Let $M$ be the midpoint of $AB$ and $N$ be the midpoint of $CQ$. 
 Prove that $AD$, $MN$ and $BC$ are concurrent.
\footnote{Haruka Kimura found an absolutely brilliant radical axis solution
 so there are multiple nice ways to interpret the midpoints.}
\exercise[ARML 2024/I10] Circles $\omega_A$ (radius $2$) and $\omega_B$ (radius $3$) 
are internally tangent to circle $\gamma$ with center $O$ and radius $9$.

 Given that $TO = 2AB$, compute $AB$.

let $M$ be the midpoint of $BC$ and let $E$ and $F$ be the feet of the altitudes from $B$ and $C$, respectively. 
Let $K$ be the intersection of the common external tangents of $(BME)$ and $(CMF)$.
