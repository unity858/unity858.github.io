<h1>MOP 2025 outro</h1>
When I arrived this year, I expected to be an outcast among the students and staff.
  Instead, I was actually quite welcomed by both. What resulted was an experience similar 
  in enjoyability yet very different from the old days of 2023: geometry grinding, 
  playing tractor/mahjong (and winning a yakuman off AL), being amused by student solutions, etc.
<h2>Regrets</h2>
<ul>
<li>Sadly, only my ghost can attend the MOP 2025 talent show, 
but LYZ can definitely exceed what I would have done. After all,
she is the one who made the MOP 2022 vlog.</li>
<li>I was planning on teaching you how to draw circles but never got the opportunity to.</li>
<li>Sadly I can't come on the excursion but do root for studnets to visit Brookfield Zoo.
I can't lead a group but the other TA's are just as cool!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Final remarks</h2>
I have always believed in ignoring insensible rules, as well as helping others, especially
my own students. Even at greater personal risk, I will continue to stand for this.

<h1>FAQ</h1>
<ol>
  <li><i>Why are you leaving MOP early?</i><br>
  There was an incident involving two students for which I was blamed to have enabled- I let them
  into their dorms an hour earlier than expected, immediately after class ended.</li>
  <li><i>What happened with the two students?</i><br>
  They were sent home by MAA high command for a borderline violation of the student handbook rules.</li>
</ol>
<h3>P.S.</h3>
It was I who wrote the ELXMO.
